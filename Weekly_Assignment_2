Here is the information for Weekly Assingment 2

Code for finiding the number of protein sequences in the .fasta file.-----> sed '/NC_008535/d' Assignment_2_Coffee_Sequence.fasta | wc -m > Sorted_Data.txt
This line of code will delete all lines with "NC_008535" from the file and then count the number of characters left, which should be the single letter protien sequence data, and put it into a new file. That number is 26404.

Code for making a new file for all the names of the protein sequences in the .fasta file --> grep from Assignment_2_Coffee_Sequence.fasta | sed 's/from//g' | sed 's/NC_008535//g' | sed's/>CoarCp//g' | sort -n > Protein_Name_Data.txt
This line of code finds all lines containing "from" from the file and then deletes "from", "NC_008535", and ">CoarCP" from those lines to give you the number and name of the protein. I then added the sort command to sort the file numerically before putting that data into a new file.
