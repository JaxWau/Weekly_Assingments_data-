Here is the information for Weekly Assingment 2

Code for finiding the number of protein sequences in the .fasta file.-----> sed '/NC_008535/d' Assignment_2_Coffee_Sequence.fasta | wc -m > Sorted_Data.txt
This line of code will delete all lines with "NC_008535" from the file and then count the number of characters left, which should be the single letter protien sequence data, and put it into a new file. That number is 26404.

Code for making a new file for all the names of the protein sequences in the .fasta file --> grep from Assignment_2_Coffee_Sequence.fasta | sed 's/from//g' | sed 's/NC_008535//g' | sed's/>CoarCp//g' | sort -n > Protein_Name_Data.txt
This line of code finds all lines containing "from" from the file and then deletes "from", "NC_008535", and ">CoarCP" from those lines to give you the number and name of the protein. I then added the sort command to sort the file numerically before putting that data into a new file. 

Code for finding the number of photosystem subunits on the chromosome ----> grep photosystem Assignment_2_Coffee_Sequence.fasta | grep subunit
This line of code finds all lines in the file that contains "phostosystem" in it and then finds the lines that contain "subunit" from the lines previously found. In total there arethree photosystem subunits in this .fasta file (VIII, IX, and VII),

Code for making a .fasta file for the sequences of ATP synthase CF1 beta subunit protein sequence ----> grep -A 1 CF1 Assignment_2_Coffee_Sequence.fasta | grep -A 1 beta > ATP_Synthase.fasta
This code first finds all instances of "CF1" within the file and prints that line and the following line ( -A 1), it then looks for all instances of "beta" from those that contain "CF1" and then prints out that line and the next into a new file titled ATP_Synthase.fasta.
