Summary of Main findings:
After using RNA-Seq to investigate the gene expression in schizophenic patients the researchers found quite a few upregulated,
569 genes, and downregulated, 192 genes. Those that were upregulated were stated to have been affected "immune responses" and 
"blood vessel developmet" whereas those that were downregulated were involed in pathways like "behavior" and "synaptic transimission".


Hypothesis they tested:
The researchers tested RNA-Seq data for genes in schizophrenia so that they could see if therapudic approaches that target the function
and expression of specific gene networks for patients with schizophrenia. 

Experimental Design for RNA-Seq portion:


Pipline for RNA-Seq analysis:

Statistical?Quatitiative analysis for the data:
Used FPKM to normalize the data and then obtained P-values, Q-values, and Log2(FC) from them using three different statistical programs
cutdif, edgeR, and DEseq2.
