Here are the answers for the questions for Weekly Asignment 4. 
1. The reads were of good quality with no trimming needed to be done. 
2. After using cutaput the adaptors were trimmed a total of 5381 times for the foreward read R1 and 5358 times for the secord read R2. 
96.26% of the genome mapped to the reference genome while 3.74% did not align to the reference genome.
Here are the commands used for the mapping process:
bowtie2 -x C.hydro -1 C.hydro_6008_R1.fastq -2 C.hydro_6008_R2.fastq -S 6008.sam. This is also the same code that we used in class for this bacterium.
