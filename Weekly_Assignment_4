Here are the answers for the questions for Weekly Asignment 4. 
1. The reads were of good quality and trimming was done to ensure top quality of reads. This is the code used: cutadapt -q 20,20 -a CTGTCTCTTATACACATCTCCGAGCCCACGAGAC -A CTGTCTCTTATACACATCTGACGCTGCCGACGA -m 50 --max-n 0 -o C.HydorF_R1.cutadapt.fastq -p C.HydorF_R2.cutadapt.fastq C.HydorF_R1.fastq C.HydorF_R2.fastq

2. After using cutaput the adaptors were trimmed 18001 times for read 1 (R1) and 14855 times for read 2 (R2).
Here are the commands used for the mapping process:
bowtie2 -x C.hydro -1 C.HydorF_R1.cutadapt.fastq -2 C.HydorF_R2.cutadapt.fastq -S HydroF.sam
76.54% of the reads matched the reference genome while 23.46% of the reads did not match to the reference genome. 



The below code was where I got before you're email. If it is ok, I will still go through with the Canvas assignment becuase I found the separation of SNPs intriguing. 
**To get varients from these reads HydroF.sam was first turned into a different file called HydoF.bam using the following code:
samtools view -b HydroF.sam | samtools sort - > C.Hydrof.bam
This new .bam file was then indexed using samtools index C.HydroF.bam
The varients within the C.HydroF.bam file were then called using the following code:
bcftools mpileup C.hydrogenoformans_Z2901.fasta C.HydroF.bam | bcftools call -mv -Ob --ploidy 1 -o raw.callsF.bcf**
